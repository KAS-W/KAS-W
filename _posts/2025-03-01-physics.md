## 🏀 Physics in Action: Optimizing Basketball Shooting with Kinematics

📄 [How should basketball players adjust the optimal shooting angle and initial speed based according to their height and shooting distance](https://ellianali.github.io/assets/pdf/BinxiLi_final_physics.pdf)

This paper written by me explores the physics behind basketball shooting using classical mechanics and projectile motion theory.

Through a derivation of the equations of motion, I analyzed the relationship between a player’s **shooting height**, **distance from the hoop**, and the resulting **optimal angle and initial velocity** needed to maximize scoring efficiency. The research models the trajectory of the ball without air resistance or spin, solving for closed-form expressions of angle and velocity, then visualizing their dependence through 3D plots.

### Key Findings:
- As **distance increases**, optimal shooting angle **decreases**, and required velocity **increases**.
- For **shorter players**, a **higher angle and greater speed** are required to score at the same distance.
- The impact of height is more significant in **close-range** shots than from the three-point line.
- The study challenges the stereotype that “basketball is only for tall people” — success is about mastering the physics 📐

> This paper bridges theory and athletic performance — showing that even a game played with instinct and flair is ultimately governed by elegant laws of motion.
