## üìê Research in Stochastic Processes: Stopping Times and Stopped Processes

üìÑ [Stopping Times and Stopped Processes](https://ellianali.github.io/assets/pdf/Stopping_time.pdf)

This research, completed at my senior year, provides a rigorous exploration of **stopping times and stopped processes** in discrete-time probability spaces. Under the supervision of Prof. Vahagn Nersesyan, we formalized the equivalence definitions of stopping times, examined stopping rules in a two-period binary market, and constructed counterexamples that require future information‚Äîthus violating the definition.

The report further introduces the concept of **stopped processes**, derives their representations, and proves that the stopped version of a (super/sub)martingale retains its respective properties. Proofs include decomposition via indicator functions and expectations under filtration, illustrating the core principles behind **optional stopping theorems**.
