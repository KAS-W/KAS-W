## ðŸŽ“ Capstone Spotlight: Reinforcement Learning and Deep Neural Networks for Hedging

ðŸ“„ [Optimizing Derivative Hedging Strategies: RL Approach and Deep Neural Networks Approach](https://ellianali.github.io/assets/pdf/Final_BinxiLi_Capstone.pdf)

This capstone research investigates how **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)** can improve derivative hedging under realistic market frictions.

ðŸ“Œ Instead of relying on traditional delta hedging, we train RL agents to dynamically adjust hedge ratios by minimizing both **expected cost** and **risk** (standard deviation), accounting for transaction costs and volatility shifts.

ðŸ§ª We compared:
- RL-based methods (e.g. Q-learning)
- Deep learning models (RNN, TCN, Transformer)
- Classical delta hedging

ðŸ“Š Results:
- RL and DNN strategies **outperformed traditional hedging** in volatile regimes
- Transformer-based models offered high adaptability under complex dynamics
- Learned policies adapted to cost tradeoffs and gamma exposure
