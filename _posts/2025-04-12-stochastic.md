## ðŸ“š Independent Study: Stochastic Calculus and Derivative Pricing

ðŸ“„ [Read the full PDF](https://ellianali.github.io/assets/pdf/Stochastic.pdf)

This independent study written by myself, conducted under the supervision of Professor Roberto Fernandez at NYU Shanghai, explores the mathematical foundations of **stochastic calculus** and its applications in modern quantitative finance. It traces the development of stochastic processes from Brownian motion and martingales to ItÃ´ integrals, Doeblin formulas, and the **Black-Scholes-Merton model**.

Key topics include:

- Construction of ItÃ´ integrals and the Doeblin formula
- Derivation and PDE analysis of the Black-Scholes equation
- Extensions to **geometric Brownian motion**, dividend-paying assets, and **barrier options**
- A deep dive into **multivariate stochastic calculus** and its role in modeling correlated assets
- The probabilistic foundation of **exotic derivatives**, such as up-and-out calls

ðŸ§  Through rigorous proof-based development and applied financial modeling, this study demonstrates the power of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in pricing and hedging a wide range of derivative products.
