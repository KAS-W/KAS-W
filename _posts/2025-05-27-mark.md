# üìò Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Techniques with Regularization, Trading Constraints, and Risk Factors


## üß† Summary

This paper done by me and Zhihan, Yueyang explores extensions to the classical Markowitz mean-variance portfolio optimization framework by introducing:

- ‚úÖ L1 (LASSO), L2 (Ridge), and Elastic Net regularization
- üìâ Volume-based and volatility-aware trading constraints
- üßÆ Bi-level optimization for determining asset and cash weight bounds
- üìä Realistic cost modeling and return forecasting frameworks
- üß™ Extensive 3-month rolling backtests from 2020‚Äì2025

We show that Ridge regularization combined with practical trading constraints consistently delivers the most robust and high-performing portfolios in both return and risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, CVaR, MDD).

> üî• TL;DR: Modernizing Markowitz with regularization + constraints = alpha-generating machine!

## üóÇÔ∏è Key Contributions

| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **LASSO / Ridge / Elastic Net** | Promote sparsity, reduce overfitting, and balance diversification |
| **Trading Constraints** | Control for liquidity via volume limits and volatility filters |
| **Bi-level Optimization** | Tune bounds on portfolio weights and cash to maximize Sharpe ratio |
| **Backtesting Framework** | Evaluate robustness under 3-month rolling windows |
| **Performance & Risk Evaluation** | Compare models on net return, cost, drawdown, and more |

## üìà Results Snapshot

| Model | Gross Return | Net Return | Sharpe | Max Drawdown |
|-------|--------------|------------|--------|---------------|
| Classical | 4.46% | 1.81% | 0.571 | -12.6% |
| LASSO     | 4.48% | 2.10% | 0.562 | -11.5% |
| **Ridge**     | **4.62%** | **3.08%** | **0.622** | **-11.0%** |
| Elastic Net | 4.40% | 2.55% | 0.564 | -13.9% |

üîß The Ridge model emerges as the winner with the best return-cost balance and lowest realized volatility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code

The code includes:

- ETF data preprocessing with `yfinance`
- Optimization routines using `cvxpy`
- Custom constraints: trading volume, price gap, volatility jump
- Portfolio performance metrics: Sharpe, VaR, CVaR, Max Drawdown
- Visualization tools for returns and risk profiles

> All implementation details can be found in the `notebooks/` and `models/` folders (you can create them and place your Jupyter Notebooks or scripts there).

## üí° Future Work

- Incorporating ML-driven return forecasts (e.g., LSTM, XGBoost)
- Adaptive regularization tuning via Bayesian optimization
- Expansion to multi-asset portfolios or international ETFs
